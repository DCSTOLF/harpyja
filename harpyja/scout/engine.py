"""`ScoutEngine` — Tier 1 behind the shared `Locator` (`.search`) seam.

The engine is self-seeding: every call runs its own lightweight Tier-0 lookup
(`seed_fn`) *before* invoking the backend, so an explicit `mode=fast` request
(which skipped `auto`'s Tier-0 pass) still hands the backend warm hints. Seed
errors are deliberately **not** caught — a missing hard precondition (e.g. `rg`)
propagates loudly rather than collapsing into a silent empty (the degradation
floor). Backend output is untrusted and is normalized before return.
