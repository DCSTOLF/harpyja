# Harpyja

A read-only, offline MCP server that turns a natural-language query into exact `file:line` citations across large/legacy/air-gapped codebases.

## Stack

- Python 3.12+
- FastMCP (MCP server; stdio + streamable HTTP)
- Tree-sitter (symbol layer: Go, Rust, Python, JS/TS, C#, Java, C/C++) + ripgrep fallback
- Microsoft FastContext (Tier 1 "Scout", pinned dependency)
- DSPy `dspy.RLM` over Deno/Pyodide WASM sandbox (Tier 2 "Deep")
- Local OpenAI-compatible model endpoint: llama.cpp (`llama-server`) or Ollama (4B-class quantized, 8 GB GPU profile)
- `uv` for env/deps

## Architecture in one paragraph

A FastMCP server exposes three tools (`locate` / `read` / `index`) and holds no business logic. The Orchestrator classifies each query, then runs the cheapest tier that can answer: Tier 0 (deterministic tree-sitter symbols + ripgrep), Tier 1 (Scout, a FastContext adapter), and Tier 2 (Deep, a `dspy.RLM` over bounded read-only host tools). A Verification Gate reads cited lines back and escalates on failure; a Citation Formatter merges, ranks, and clamps results. The Model Gateway is the single outbound abstraction, pointed only at localhost — the one place the air-gap guarantee is enforced. Every layer has a fallback so retrieval never goes blind.

## Hard rules (see guardrails.md)

- No network egress at runtime — model/search/parsing stay local; only the Model Gateway calls out, and only to localhost.
- Read-only — Harpyja returns citations and never edits, writes, or generates code in the target repo.
- Always degrade gracefully — no parser → ripgrep; no model → Tier 0; escalation fails → best-effort Tier 1 with a confidence flag.

## Where to look

- MCP server / transports: `harpyja/server/`
- Routing, classifier, verification gate, formatter: `harpyja/orchestrator/`
- File walker / manifest / hashing: `harpyja/index/`
- Tree-sitter + ripgrep engines (`CodeSpan`): `harpyja/symbols/`
- Tier 1 Scout (FastContext adapter): `harpyja/scout/`
- Tier 2 Deep (`dspy.RLM` + host tools): `harpyja/deep/`
- Model Gateway (llama.cpp / Ollama): `harpyja/gateway/`
- Settings / profiles: `harpyja/config/`
- CLI entrypoints (serve/index/locate/read): `harpyja/cli.py`

## Recent decisions (last 3)

- 2026-06-26 — **Wave 0 foundations shipped** (specs/0001-wave-0-foundations/): stub-first `harpyja_locate` MCP contract; air-gap in one helper (`gateway.assert_local`, incl. inbound HTTP loopback default + `--allow-remote-bind`); config precedence on a frozen `Settings`; co-located `test_*.py`.
- 2026-06-26 — **speccraft adopted**: spec-first TDD workflow; all code changes go through `/spec:new`.
